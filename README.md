# CoffeeSpoons

>For I have known them all already, known them all:<br/>
>Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,<br/>
>I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;<br/>
>I know the voices dying with a dying fall<br/>
>Beneath the music from a farther room.<br/>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;So how should I presume?<br/>
>
>  The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock<br/>
>  -T.S. Eliot
